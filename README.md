#**My Page for Spider Webdev Inductions!**

Welcome to my humble abode.

This is my page for the Webdev Inductions held by Spider. 

My first attempt at HTML. 

Learning HTML has been an enthralling experience so far and I can't wait to see what lies ahead!
Hope you like what you see.

First things first though!

![Hello there](images/hello.png) 

My name is **Nikita Sivakumar**.

Second year I will be entering into, in the coming Academic Year!

And in College so far,

*I was a part of the Western Dance team that won during Aaveg.

*I also enjoy my fair share of Sports. Cricket, in fact being my favorite. 
I was part of the team that came first in Cricket during this years' Sports Fete. 
Quite an experience I must say!

*In my first month, I won the Miss. Fresher Competition. 
Unexpected,funny and quirky is what I would describe that event as!
And it helped me meet a lot of new, nice people! Very Grateful.

My ReadMe Page ideally should be light.Not too much, yet not too less.

And what better way to make a page light, than put a joke in it.

### The Joke

What did Usain Bolt say when he got mad?

>Skipping lines for dramatic pause and pretence interest

**He said, "Jamaican me crazy!"**

{To be read as (Yo' making)me crazy!"}

Beauty, eh?
Jokes I love. Reading them, listening to them and much to my friends' annoyance, telling them!

### The Calculator

The past few days have involved me sitting on my laptop, reading a lot of HTML and trying to build a Calculator as per the task.
The Calculator I have built is of The Kit-Kat design, as that is what I have on my Smartphone. 
It involves the basic operations:
Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide along with the option to Single backspace, or Completely Clear.

### Instructions to obtain my working calculator on your local machine:

1) Towards the right of my github page, you will notice the "Download ZIP" option.

Click on it.

2)Unzip the file you just saved. You will find a folder named "nikki30.github.io-master".

Open it.

The only three in consideration are: index.html, test.css and calc-second-stage.html.

3)Click on index.html. It will take you to my intro page where you will also find the link saying "Calculator".

Clicking on it will take you to My Calculator.
